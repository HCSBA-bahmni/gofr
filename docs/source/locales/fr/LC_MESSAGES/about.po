"built using the emerging FHIR standard based on the mCSD IHE profile. The"
" backend is a FHIR server which means that a FHIR-compliant API is "
"available from server for operations. All data sources are converted to "
"FHIR Location Resources. This means that ordinary FHIR REST API queries "
"can be pursued against the backend server."
