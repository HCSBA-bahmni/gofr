# Match

Reconciling data sources involves choosing a pair of sources to work with and then running the automatic or manual matching tool. Any kind of match can be undone.

## Pair sources

On the pair tab select one source on the left and one on the right. The source on the left (source 1) is the data the follower, the data that is meant to be cleaned. The source on the right is the leader, the source that is the source of truth.
