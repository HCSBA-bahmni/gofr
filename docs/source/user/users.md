# User Management

There are two classes of users, admin and data managers. The initial server configuration includes on administrator role. This account and password should be immediately changed after installation. See the Developer Guide for more information.

## Roles

* **Admin** accounts can add users and manage workspaces.

* **Data manager** accounts can manage data only.

* **Custom** accounts with specific roles may be created in the future. Please let the community know if you have use cases for custom account roles.

## Adding to a Pair

Data managers and administrators are able to add other users to help with reconciliation. To do so, the data source pairing has an option to share the pairing with another user.
