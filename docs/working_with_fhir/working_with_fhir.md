# Working with FHIR

FHIR describes both a REST API based on common requests/queries and more than 130 data structures. There are many resources for learning FHIR, and the basics are covered elsewhere. A hosted demo system can be used to increase your understanding of FHIR basics. Some great resources are:

* The [HAPI FHIR Test Server](http://hapi.fhir.org/) The test server has a great web interface so you don't need to dig into a terminal to issues commmands.
* SmileCDR's [Intro to FHIR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbQcJj1GqH0&t=2175s). This is a video that explains the why and how of FHIR.
