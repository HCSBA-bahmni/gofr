# Essentials

There are several essential features of GOFR.

## Data Partitions

Data is loaded into a partition. Users may have access to one or many partitions, some of which they may own or be able to share. Admins may view all partitions. 

To know what partition you are on, see the list on the top left, which allows switching partitions.
